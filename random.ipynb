      "The lecture discussed domain adaptation, which involves adapting models trained on one domain to perform well on another domain. It touched on concepts like concept shift, semi-supervised data placement, and source-free domain adaptation. The lecture also mentioned techniques like tracking invariance and temporal consistency to improve model performance. Additionally, it highlighted the importance of learning local models instead of general models in certain situations. The lecture concluded by emphasizing the significance of understanding the specific characteristics of the data and adapting models accordingly.\n",

      " maybe you find something spam, like when you label, you say, oh, this is very interesting. So here this is concept shift. Okay, just a little bit of technology. what we call semi-supervised data placement where the SOC data in the target data makes ladder data. Not enough, and not enough data to semi-supervise on the target side. In the S-subtabular data distribution, we have the SOCs, where we have the only data which is laddered, oh yes, in those we have so fast laddered data in the target. Okay, so here, no laddered data. And in the source-free domain of HG, we don't even have the training data in the source, but only the hypotheses which we have the concepts. Because of priority concepts, you don't want to communicate the source data. You just want to communicate, you have already communicated the hypothesis, the source hypothesis, but not the source data. Okay, for instance, you have a NOS feed on a block. which has a latency with the patients and with the consumers. You don't want to transmit information to the consumers of the business, but you are willing to transmit. right? this is called sans\n"
